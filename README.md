## What is **Palmr.** ?  

**Palmr.** is a powerful and **flexible open-source alternative** to popular file transfer services like **WeTransfer**, **SendGB**, **Send Anywhere**, and **Files.fm**.  

### See full documentation here: https://palmr-docs.kyantech.com.br

✅ **Host it on your own infrastructure** (Dedicated Server or VPS).  
🔒 **Full control over your files & security** (No third-party dependencies).  
🚀 **No artificial limits or hidden fees** (Unlimited file sharing).  


## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**  

Each component in the **Palmr.** architecture plays a vital role in ensuring reliability, performance, and scalability:  

### 🐘 PostgreSQL  
Palmr. uses **PostgreSQL** as the primary database solution.  
⚡ High performance and reliability.  
🔎 Advanced indexing and query optimization.  
🛡️ Secure and scalable data storage.  

### ⚛️ React + TypeScript + Vite  
The frontend of **Palmr.** is built using modern web technologies:  
🎨 **React** → Component-based UI for a dynamic user experience.  
📝 **TypeScript** → Static typing for better code quality.  
⚡ **Vite** → Lightning-fast development & HMR support.  

### ☁️ MinIO (Object Storage)  
Palmr. leverages **MinIO** for scalable file storage:  
📂 **High-throughput storage & retrieval**.  
🛡️ **Ensures data integrity & redundancy**.  
🔄 **Fully compatible with AWS S3 APIs**.  

### ⚡ Fastify (Backend API)  
The backend of **Palmr.** is powered by **Fastify**, a high-performance Node.js framework:  
🚀 **Super-fast request handling**.  
🛡️ **Built-in schema-based validation** for secure APIs.  
🔌 **Plugin-based architecture** for easy extensibility.
